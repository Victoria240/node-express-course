1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

Middleware functions in an Express application are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. They can perform various tasks, such as executing code, modifying the request and response objects, ending the request-response cycle, and calling the next middleware function in the stack. Middleware can be used for logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, and handling errors.

2. What does CRUD stand for?

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a database or persistent storage.

3. a. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?

To access the information in a .env file, you use the dotenv package in your Node.js application. First, install the package using npm: npm install dotenv

Then, require and configure it at the top of your main app file (in this case, app.js): require('dotenv').config();

This will load the environment variables from the .env file into `process.env`, allowing you to access them in your application code using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.

b. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?

To protect the contents of the .env file from being stored in your Github repository, it should be included in the .env file in your .gitignore file. The .gitignore file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore and not track.
